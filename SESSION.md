# SESSION.md

Running log of where the work is. Updated at the end of every session
(by you, or by Claude via `/end-session`). Newest session on top.
Keep "Current state" short and always true.

## Current state
- **Phase:** 0 — Foundations (complete except provider API keys)
- **Branch:** main · remote `github.com/AndrewTtofi/llm-gateway` (private) · CI green
- **Status:** Python 3.14 / Redis 8 / Postgres 18; stack up, `/healthz` 200, fresh clone → healthz in 13s (images cached), `make test` 10 passed, `make lint` clean
- **Next up:** owner adds `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` + `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env`; then Phase 1 on branch `phase-1-proxy`
- **Blockers:** none (API keys only needed for live tests)
- **Open questions:** none

## Session log

### 2026-10-05 — Session 3
**Did**
- Dependency audit: installed versions were all latest, but nothing was pinned (only `>=` floors)
- Added pip-tools locks with hashes, raised floors, pinned Docker images, Dependabot (branch `chore/pin-deps`)

**Decided**
- Kept Redis 7 / Postgres 16 / Python 3.12 majors; Postgres 18 needs a pgdata migration — separate decision
- Standard pip-tools layout (`.in` → `.txt`) so Dependabot can regenerate locks

- Merged PR #1. Then major upgrades on `chore/major-upgrades`: Python 3.14.8, Redis 8.8.3, Postgres 18.6
- Postgres 18 image stores data under `/var/lib/postgresql/18/docker`; mount moved to `/var/lib/postgresql`.
  Old PG16 volume had 0 tables — dumped (`pg_dumpall`) then removed and recreated
- Local `.venv` rebuilt on Python 3.14.8 (via `uv python install`, no system changes)

**Learned**
- Upgrading Postgres majors in Docker is never just a tag bump: data dirs are version-specific (pg_upgrade or dump/restore)

**Next**
- Merge `chore/major-upgrades`, then Phase 1


### 2026-10-05 — Session 2
**Did**
- Created `.venv`, installed dev deps; `make test` / `make lint` run
- Fixed ruff E501 failures in `app/main.py` (CI would have been red)
- Admin key check now uses `secrets.compare_digest` (timing-safe)
- HTTP errors returned in OpenAI error shape
- Added `tests/test_api.py` (healthz, /v1/models, /admin/reload auth)
- CI lint step now runs mypy too, matching `make lint`

- Created `.env` from example with a generated `GATEWAY_ADMIN_KEY` (API keys still empty)
- `make up`: all 5 services healthy; `/admin/reload` works with the admin key
- Pulled `ollama/llama3.2:3b`; verified the container reaches Ollama via `host.docker.internal`
- Filled OpenAI models: fast → `gpt-6-luna`, balanced → `gpt-6.1-sol`, smart → `gpt-6-astra`
- Filled all prices in `pricing.yaml` (checked 2026-10-05); test that every chain model is priced
- `git init`, repo-local identity, pushed to private GitHub repo; first CI run green

**Decided**
- Repo is private for now; flip to public at Phase 7

**Next**
- Owner: add provider API keys to `.env`
- Phase 1 — pass-through proxy


### 2026-10-05 — Session 1
**Did**
- Chose project: LLM gateway (#11) as first AI engineering project
- Generated repo scaffold: PLAN, CLAUDE.md, agents, skills, Docker stack, config files

**Decided**
- Python + FastAPI (AI ecosystem language) over Go
- OpenAI-compatible API surface
- All models/prices in `config/` so models can be swapped without code changes

**Next**
- Phase 0 tasks in PLAN.md
